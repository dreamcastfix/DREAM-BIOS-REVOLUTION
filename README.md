# DREAM-BIOS-REVOLUTION
As part of the efforts to keep alive the projects that allow the Sega Dreamcast an alternative to optical readers, follow another project that I worked or was part of ... feel free to use the files at will.

The DREAM BIOS REVOLUTION project ALLOWS TO ADD AN ALTERNATIVE BIOS TO SEGA DREAMCAST

It is basically a board that transforms the PSOP 44 into TSOP48, in this case the pinout is based on the MX29LV160TMC-90 and MX29LV160DTBI-70G
